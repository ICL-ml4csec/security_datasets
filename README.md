# security_datasets
Notes on security datasets of ALL kinds with PREPROCESSING available :)

## Format of documents

We will worry about the directory structure later, but the following must be included with each note:

- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of it
- The location or instructions on how to gain access to the dataset
- Bibtex citation for said dataset
- Pre-processing instructions for those that do not know how to use the dataset
- (Optional but preferred) PyTorch Dataset class for how to load the dataset - with Train/Val/Test split options
